Most functions in IGraph/M are based on the igraph library (http://igraph.org/) created by Gábor Csárdi and Tamás Nepusz. To cite igraph in publications, see http://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-introduction.html and use:

 - Gábor Csárdi, Tamás Nepusz: The igraph software package for complex network research. InterJournal Complex Systems, 1695, 2006.

Some functions, especially in the functionality area of planar graphs, make use of the LEMON graph library (https://lemon.cs.elte.hu).

The proximity graph calculations make use of the nanoflann library (https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann).

The following people have contributed to IGraph/M:

 - Henrik Schumacher contributed to the functions for constructing mesh-cell adjacency graphs and proximity graphs.

IGraph/M was created with the help of the Mathematica plugin for IntelliJ IDEA by Patrick Scheibe, http://wlplugin.halirutan.de/
Without the help of this IDE, it would have been difficult to manage to complexity of this package.

The help of the Mathematica StackExchange community was invaluable while developing this package.
